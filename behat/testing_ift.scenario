Feature: This is a sample feature file to just test IFT flagging script.
  In order to service orders
  As a Customer Service Agent
  I must be able to view, manage and forward results from iLab

  Background:
    Given "stdcheck.com" will send the following notification for a "Final Results" event:
        | subject | Final Results |
      And "stdcheck.com" will send the following notification for a "Partial Results" event:
        | subject | Partial Results |
      And "stdcheck.com" will send the following notification for a "Abnormal Results" event:
        | subject | Abnormal Results |
      And "stdcheck.com" will send the following notification for a "Positive for HSV" event:
        | subject | You are Positive for HSV |
      And "stdcheck.com" will send the following notification for a "Blocked Results" event:
        | subject | Results available but show me the money |
      And "stdcheck.com" will send the following notification for a "Results Needs Address" event:
        | subject | Results available but we need your address |
      And "stdcheck.com" will send the following notification for a "Results Need Recollected" event:
        | subject | Results available but sample need recollection |

  Scenario: iLab enzo test abnormal result parsed and interpreted properly
    Given a Enzo Clinical Labs lab in TX exists
      And there is an order
      And the order has a payment status of "Complete"
      And iLab sent a resulting message for Order with the following message:
          """
          MSH|^~\&|ENZO|ENZO|Medology|FPKService^439|201706121619||ORU^R01|201706121619|P|2.5.1

          NTE|2|L|William F Hancock, MD
          """
     Then the order should have the following test results:
        | test_name   | result_status | result_date         |
        | Hepatitis A | abnormal      | 2017-06-08 00:00:00 |
      And the following "App\Model\Customer\Order" should exist in the system:
        | customer_id | (the customer_id of the Order) |
        | is_active   | true                           |
      And the following "App\Model\LabOrder" should exist in the system:
        | Order Id | (the Customer Id of the Order) |
      And the following "App\Model\TestResult" should exist in the system:
        | Lab Order Id | (the Id of the LabOrder) |
        | type         | final                    |
    Given I have logged into manage
      And I am on "/manage/patients.php"
     When I view Test Results for "(the First Name of the Order)" "(the Last Name of the Order)"
     Then I should see "Uploaded by System"
      And I should see "Type: final"
      And the following email should be sent:
        | subject | You have an important message in your account |
      And there should be a message with a title of "Abnormal Results"
      And there should not be a message with a title of "You are Positive for HSV"
      And there should not be a message with a title of "Final Results"
